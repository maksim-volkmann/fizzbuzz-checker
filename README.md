### Example of the exercise:
```
Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100, each separated by a
newline.

If the number is a multiple of 3, it prints 'fizz' instead.

If the number is a multiple of 5, it prints 'buzz' instead.

If the number is both a multiple of 3 and a multiple of 5, it prints 'fizzbuzz' instead.

Example:

$>./fizzbuzz
1
2
fizz
4
buzz
fizz
7
8
fizz
buzz
11
fizz
13
14
fizzbuzz
[...]
97
98
fizz
buzz
$>
```
